Copying permissions for safecat comes in two parts:

  1. All code written by me is offered under the BSD license. See below
     for the text of the BSD license. Original content is clearly marked
     with a copyright notice and my name.

  2. Other components of the package, like the programs ``setup'' and
     ``instcheck'', were derived from code written by Dan Bernstein.
     Dan has not specified the licensing of (some of) his code; some of
     his code he has released into the public domain.

     My best understanding of Dan's position, based on what he has
     written on the subject, is that he doesn't mind if people borrow
     his code--as long as you make supporting that code your own problem.
     In particular, the following considerations apply:

     a. If you have problems with safecat or anything in this
        distribution, contact me about it--<lbudney@pobox.com>. Do NOT
        bother Dan.

     b. If you think you've found problems in Dan's code, as contained
        in this distribution, contact me first anyway. If I can verify
        that the bug exists and isn't mine, I'll pass the info on to Dan.
	Do NOT bother Dan.

     c. If you want to use Dan's code for your own projects, then
        1) you do so at your own risk, and 2) you should assume full
        responsibility for maintenance of your project, including borrowed
        code, just as I'm doing here for safecat.
